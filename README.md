# Two's Complement / ASCII

Prepare your answers in [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) format in file *RESPONSES.md*.

## Problem 1 - Signed Decimal to Two's Complement

Convert each of these signed decimal numbers to 8-bit two's complement.

- 14
- -22
- 100
- -80
- -4

Express your answers for each in *both* binary and hexadecimal form. For example, if the decimal number given is -32, express your answer as follows:

```
-32 = 11100000 = E0
```

## Problem 2 - Two's Complement to Signed Decimal

Convert each of these 8-bit two's complement hexadecimal numbers to signed decimal.

- 4B
- F0
- 8D
- EE
- AF

Express your answers in only decimal form. For example, if the hexadecimal number given is 12, express your answer as follows:

```
12 = 18
```

## Problem 3 - Identify Positive / Negative

For each of the following 32-bit two's complement hexadecimal numbers, state whether the decimal number represented is positive or negative. State only positive or negative for each; you don't need to provide the conversion.

- 4A39FD31
- E3BCC76F
- 6EDDC428
- 9C662DEB
- A000FFFF
- BBAA0000
- 7FFFFFFF
- FFFF0000
- DDFFFF00
- 84FDC2AA

Simply state the word "Positive" or "Negative". For example, if the hexadecimal number given is 00000005, express your answer as follows:

```
00000005 - Positive
```

## Problem 4 - String to ASCII Values

For each of these strings, show their corresponding ASCII hexadecimal representation.

- Hola Mundo!
- #comporg
- 3.14159
- F=(9.0/5)*C+32
- AaBbCcDd

Include a space between each 8 bits (or 2 hexdigits) for readability. For example, if the string given is *YoYo*, express your answer as follows:

```
YoYo = 59 6F 59 6F
```
